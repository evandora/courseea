            "source": "India (ISO: Bh\u0101rat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bh\u0101rat Ga\u1e47ar\u0101jya) is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2017 was nominally worth USD2.611 trillion; it is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is, at USD9.459 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity, or PPP. With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011\u201312, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, the country ranks 140th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 129th in GDP per capita at PPP. Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then it has slowly moved towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows. India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.\n\nWith this economic growth and development and also high population rate, India is very promising country for construction and sanitaryware product business. \n\nIn this project, I will investigate the best location opportunity for sanitary business in India and I choose one of the major city of India, Mumbai for researching. Mumbai is capital city of Maharastra and it is the most populous city in India with estimated population over 21 million as of 2016.It serves as an economic hub of India, contributing 10% of factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, 20% of central excise tax collections, 40% of India's foreign trade and \u20b940 billion (US$580 million) in corporate taxes. Along with the rest of India, Mumbai has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and outsourcing boom in the 2000s. \n",

Hierarchical clustering gave and advantage as it does not require to set cluster number initially. \nlater for better visualization center of clusters are obtained by calculating mean values of both groups and plotted on Folium map.\nLater I also searched for Vitra offices in Mumbai and located this office compared to this clusters.\n\n\n\n\n",
